Available Views:

-> Boat view: This is a view from the ship’s position where only a part of the world in front is
visible. In other words, in this view, we see what the ship sees, as if we were the ship.

-> Top View: This is a top-down view, as if we were looking vertically downwards from a position
in the sky. This gives a clear picture of the path.

-> Tower view: Here, the camera is sitting on a tower, to the side of the plane of playing,
observing it at an angle.

-> Follow-cam view: This is a view of the ship and the region in front of it from a location behind
and above it, as if the camera is following the ship.

-> Helicopter-cam view: Here, the camera is movable with the mouse in an intuitive manner.
Clicking and dragging should change the look angle, the up vector should remain up always,and the scroll wheel will move the camera closer or farther away from the scene.up vector
should remain up always, and the scroll wheel will move the camera closer or farther away from

Game:

The world consists of a large sea which has several enemies and objects present. Your boat
must have a sail and a cannon that shoots fireballs. A booster that speeds up the boat for some
time can be obtained from a monster boss drop. The world should be sufficiently big to
incorporate all the elements of the assignment. Floating barrels would be present with gifts that
give different amounts of points on top of them which can be collected by jumping over the
barrels.
Your boat must have health points. Sea monsters would spawn and on killing them, would drop
gifts. Ensure that you use different kinds of monsters in your game. The sea monsters can
damage the boat and reduce your health points. The game ends when you lose all your health
points. After killing several sea monsters, a monster boss would spawn and on killing woulddrop the booster. The drops would float on the water and you must go over them to pick them
up.
There would be rocks present in the sea and if you do not maneuver around them, you will lose
health points. At random times, a strong wind would start blowing in any particular direction.
Your boat must change its speed according to the direction of the wind.
